# Summit-Solutions-Inc.-Sales-and-Profit-Dashboardüìñ Project Story
Summit Solutions Inc. Sales and Profit Dashboard is an interactive Power BI report designed to provide business leaders with a clear view of company performance. It consolidates key metrics ‚Äî Total Sales (4.38M), Gross Profit (2.26M), and Profit Margin (52%) ‚Äî into an executive-ready dashboard.

The dashboard breaks down sales trends by month, region, category, and channel, revealing where growth and profit are strongest. Key insights show that Asia-Pacific and Europe drive performance, while Online sales dominate with 60.6% of total revenue. Product categories like Fashion and Electronics lead in sales, and subcategories such as Accessories and Computing contribute significantly to profitability.

With visualizations that highlight growth opportunities and risks, this dashboard turns raw sales data into actionable business intelligence. It helps executives and decision-makers quickly identify high-performing regions, channels, and categories, while also spotting underperforming areas that need strategic focus.

This project demonstrates how I apply data storytelling and visualization skills to transform complex datasets into insights that drive smarter, faster decisions.
At Summit Solutions Inc., leadership faced a familiar challenge:

‚ÄúWhich regions are driving growth?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhich product categories truly fuel profitability?‚Äù

‚ÄúAre we investing in the right sales channels?‚Äù

To answer these questions, I developed an interactive Sales and Profit Dashboard in Power BI. It transforms raw sales data into a clear story of revenue, profit, and performance across categories, regions, and channels.

üéØ The Challenge

Summit Solutions operates globally, selling products across categories like Sports, Fashion, Office Supplies, Electronics, and Home Goods. While sales were strong, management lacked visibility into:

Regional contributions to total revenue

Profitability by product category and subcategory

Channel performance (Online, Retail, Wholesale)

Monthly sales trends to spot growth and dips

üõ†Ô∏è My Approach

I designed a dashboard that:

Shows Total Sales (4.38M), Gross Profit (2.26M), and Profit Margin (52%) at a glance.

Tracks monthly sales trends across 2024‚Äì2025.

Compares regional performance (North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, Latin America, Middle East).

Breaks down sales by category (Sports, Fashion, Office, Electronics, Home).

Reveals channel performance ‚Äî Online (60.61%), Retail, and Wholesale.

Highlights subcategory profitability, showing where the business earns the most (e.g., Accessories, Computing, Apparel).

üí° Key Insights

Asia-Pacific and Europe are strong markets, while Latin America and the Middle East underperform.

Online sales dominate (60.6%), but Retail and Wholesale remain important secondary channels.

Fashion and Electronics drive high revenue, while subcategories like Accessories and Computing bring strong profitability.Tools Used
