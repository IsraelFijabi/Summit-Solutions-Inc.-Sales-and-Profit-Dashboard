Summit Solutions Inc. Sales and Profit Dashboard ðŸ“–

This project is a Sales and Profit Dashboard I built in Power BI for Summit Solutions Inc. It gives company leaders a clear picture of how the business is doing by showing key numbers like Total Sales ($4.38M), Gross Profit ($2.26M), and Profit Margin (52%).

The dashboard breaks down sales by month, region, product category, and sales channel. It helps spot where the company is growing the most and which areas are making the best profits. For example, Asia-Pacific and Europe are the strongest regions, while Online sales make up about 60.6% of the revenue. Fashion and Electronics are top-selling categories, with Accessories and Computing standing out as really profitable subcategories.

With easy-to-understand visuals, the dashboard helps leaders quickly see which regions, channels, and categories are doing well, and which ones might need more attention.

Why I Built This

The leadership team at Summit Solutions wanted answers to some important questions:

Which regions are really driving growth?

What product categories are bringing in the most profit?

Are we focusing on the right sales channels?

To help them out, I created this interactive dashboard. It takes all the sales data and turns it into a simple story about revenue, profits, and performance by region, category, and channel.

The Challenge

Summit Solutions sells a variety of products globally. From Sports and Fashion to Office Supplies and Electronics. Although sales were generally good, management didnâ€™t have a clear picture of:

Which regions contribute most to revenue

How profitable different product categories and subcategories are

How different sales channels (Online, Retail, Wholesale) perform

Monthly trends to spot growth or slowdowns

What I Did

I built a dashboard that:

Shows total sales, gross profit, and profit margin at a quick glance

Tracks monthly sales trends across 2024 and 2025

Compares sales performance across regions: North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, Latin America, Middle East

Breaks sales down by category like Sports, Fashion, Office, Electronics, Home

Shows channel sales split between Online, Retail, and Wholesale

Highlights the most profitable subcategories like Accessories, Computing, and Apparel

What I Learned

Asia-Pacific and Europe are the biggest contributors to revenue

Online sales are huge; over 60% but Retail and Wholesale still matter

Fashion and Electronics are key revenue drivers

Profit margins are healthy at 52%, showing good cost control

Sales trends show steady growth with some mid-year spikes, probably tied to promotions or seasons

Tools I Used

Power BI for building the dashboard

SQL and Excel for getting and cleaning the data

Data storytelling to make sure the dashboard clearly explains what the numbers mean

Whatâ€™s Next?

Add sales forecasting to help predict future growth

Build in more detailed views to drill down into specific countries

Set up automatic data refresh so the dashboard stays up to date

Why It Matters

This dashboard is a great example of how I turn complex sales data into simple, useful insights that help business leaders make better decisions. Itâ€™s not just numbers, itâ€™s a clear picture of where the business is doing well and where it needs to improve.
